    "In the above code, we've primarily focused on using the `default_xxx` methods of the `RAGEvaluationHarness` class. They provide a straightforward way of getting started with the evaluation of simple RAG pipelines which use prototypical components. The harness can also be used to evaluate arbitrarily complex RAG pipelines. This is done by providing the harness with some extra metadata about the pipeline to be evaluated.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use an arbitrary pipeline with the harness, the latter requires information about the following components (c.f `RAGExpectedComponent`):\n",
    "- Query processor - Component that processes the input query. \n",
    "    - Expects one input that contains the query string.\n",
    "- Document retriever - Component that retrieves documents based on the input query.\n",
    "    - Expects one output that contains the retrieved documents.\n",
    "- Response generator - Component that generates responses based on the query and the retrieved documents.\n",
    "    - Expects one output that contains the LLM's response(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "For each of the above, the user needs to provide the following metadata (c.f `RAGExpectedComponentMetadata`):\n",
    "- The name of the component as seen in the pipeline.\n",
    "- A mapping of the component's expected inputs to their corresponding input names.\n",
    "- A mapping of the component's expected outputs to their corresponding output names.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's consider `RAGExpectedComponent.QUERY_PROCESSOR`: Assume we have a RAG pipeline with an [`OpenAITextEmbedder`](https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack/blob/0ceeb733baabe2b3658ee7065c4441a632ef465d/haystack/components/embedders/openai_text_embedder.py#L18) component called `\"txt_embedder\"`. Since the harness is responsible for passing the pipeline's input (the query) to the `OpenAITextEmbedder`, it needs to know the name of the component. Furthermore, it also needs to know the [name of `OpenAITextEmbedder`'s input](https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack/blob/0ceeb733baabe2b3658ee7065c4441a632ef465d/haystack/components/embedders/openai_text_embedder.py#L135) through which the query should be supplied. The metadata for the above looks thus:\n",

    "    input_mapping={\n",
    "        \"query\": \"text\"\n",
    "    }\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "Similarly, for `RAGExpectedComponent.DOCUMENT_RETRIEVER`: Assume the RAG pipeline has an [`InMemoryEmbeddingRetriever`](https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack/blob/0ceeb733baabe2b3658ee7065c4441a632ef465d/haystack/components/retrievers/in_memory/embedding_retriever.py#L12) component named `\"mem_retriever\"` and is connected to `\"txt_embedder\"`.\n",
    "```python\n",

    "    name=\"mem_retriever\",\n",
    "    output_mapping={\n",
    "        \"retrieved_documents\": \"documents\"\n",
    "    }\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "Both `\"query\"` and `\"retrieved_documents\"` are \"meta\" identifiers used by the harness to specify expected inputs and outputs - They are specific to each `RAGExpectedComponent` enum variant and are documented in their docstrings."
